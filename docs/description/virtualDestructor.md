# Class 'Base' which is inherited by class 'Derived' does not have a virtual destructor.

1. This Cppcheck error check, identified by the error ID "virtualDestructor", looks for classes that have virtual member functions but do not have a virtual destructor. In C++, when a class contains virtual functions, it is recommended to have a virtual destructor to ensure that the destructor of the most derived class is called when deleting an object through a pointer to a base class.

2. Having a virtual destructor is important for code quality and security because without it, deleting an object through a base class pointer can lead to memory leaks. If a derived class with dynamic memory allocation is deleted through a pointer to the base class that lacks a virtual destructor, only the base class destructor is called. This means that resources allocated in the derived class may not be properly released, potentially causing memory leaks and undefined behavior.

3. To fix the issue flagged by this Cppcheck error, you should add a virtual destructor to the base class if it contains virtual member functions. By making the base class destructor virtual, the C++ runtime system ensures that the correct destructor is called when deleting an object through a pointer to the base class. This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures proper resource cleanup in class hierarchies with inheritance and polymorphism.

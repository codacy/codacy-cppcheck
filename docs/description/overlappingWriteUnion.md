# Overlapping read/write of union is undefined behavior

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `overlappingWriteUnion` Cppcheck pattern is designed to detect instances in the code where there is an overlap in reading and writing operations of a union data type. Unions in C++ allow different data types to be stored in the same memory location, and accessing one member of the union may affect the value of another member due to the shared memory space.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Detecting and fixing overlapping read/write operations in unions is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring code safety. Overlapping operations on a union can lead to undefined behavior, making the program unpredictable and potentially causing bugs, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. By identifying and resolving such issues, developers can prevent unintended consequences and improve the overall reliability and security of the software.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the issue identified by the `overlappingWriteUnion` pattern, developers should carefully review the code where the overlapping read/write operation occurs in a union. To address this problem, consider the following steps:
   - Ensure that reading and writing operations on different members of the union are performed in a safe and controlled manner.
   - Avoid scenarios where multiple members of the union are accessed simultaneously or where the same memory location is modified by different operations.
   - If necessary, redesign the code to use separate variables or data structures instead of relying on unions for storing and accessing different data types.
   - Test the modified code thoroughly to verify that the issue has been resolved and that the program behaves as expected without any overlapping read/write operations on union members.

By following these guidelines and addressing the overlapping read/write operations in unions, developers can enhance the stability, reliability, and security of their C++ codebase.

# String literal "Hello World" doesn't match length argument for substr().

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, with Error ID "incorrectStringCompare", looks for cases where a string literal is compared with a length argument in a function call, but the lengths do not match. It specifically checks for mismatches between the length of the string literal and the length argument provided to a function.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because incorrect string comparisons can lead to potential bugs, such as buffer overflows, memory corruption, or unexpected behavior in the program. When the length of a string literal does not match the expected length in a function call, it can result in errors that may be difficult to detect during testing and could potentially introduce vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.

3. To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck error, you need to ensure that the length of the string literal matches the length argument expected by the function. This can be achieved by carefully reviewing the code where the comparison is being made and verifying that the correct length is being used. If necessary, adjust the length argument or the string literal to make sure they align properly in the comparison. Additionally, consider using safer string handling functions or techniques to avoid potential vulnerabilities related to incorrect string length comparisons.

# It is inefficient to swap a object with itself by calling 'str.swap(str)'

1. The `uselessCallsSwap` Cppcheck pattern looks for instances in the code where the `swap()` function is called with the same object as both parameters. This indicates an inefficient usage of the `swap()` function, as swapping an object with itself has no logical effect and does not result in any change in the object.

2. This check matters for code quality and performance optimization. Inefficient use of functions like `swap()` can lead to unnecessary resource consumption and degrade the overall performance of the application. Identifying and fixing such issues can help in improving the efficiency of the codebase and ensuring that resources are utilized effectively.

3. To fix the issue flagged by the `uselessCallsSwap` pattern, you should review the code where the `swap()` function is being called and ensure that it is not being called with the same object as both parameters. Instead, the `swap()` function should be used to exchange the contents of two distinct objects. By correcting this usage, you can eliminate unnecessary operations and improve the performance of the code.

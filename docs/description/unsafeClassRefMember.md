# Unsafe class: The const reference member 'UnsafeClass::var' is initialized by a const reference constructor argument. You need to be careful about lifetime issues.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck error, identified by the `unsafeClassRefMember` error ID, is looking for instances where a const reference member of a class is being initialized by a const reference constructor argument. This situation is flagged as potentially unsafe because it can lead to lifetime issues in the code.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Ensuring proper initialization and management of class members is crucial for code quality and security. When a const reference member is initialized by a const reference constructor argument, there is a risk of dangling references or accessing invalid memory if the constructor argument goes out of scope before the member. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address the `unsafeClassRefMember` issue and improve code safety:
   - Review the design of the class and constructor to determine if passing a const reference is necessary.
   - If passing a const reference is essential, ensure that the lifetime of the constructor argument exceeds the lifetime of the class member.
   - Consider using non-reference variables or smart pointers for class members instead of const references to avoid lifetime issues.
   - If passing a global object that is never destroyed as the constructor argument, document this behavior clearly to indicate safe usage.
   - Be cautious when passing local variables or temporary values as constructor arguments, as they can lead to unsafe scenarios.
   - Refactor the code to establish a safer initialization strategy for const reference members, prioritizing clarity and reliability in the codebase.

# Opposite inner 'if' condition leads to a dead code block.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck pattern, identified by the Error ID "oppositeInnerCondition", aims to detect instances where code contains opposite inner conditions. In the provided snippet, the function `oppositeInnerConditionError` is checking for opposite conditions within an if statement involving `tok1` and `tok2`.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Having opposite inner conditions can lead to logic errors and potentially introduce vulnerabilities in the code. Inconsistent or contradictory conditions can result in unexpected program behavior, difficult-to-trace bugs, and even security vulnerabilities if not handled properly. Identifying and fixing such issues is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the software.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To resolve the "oppositeInnerCondition" warning raised by Cppcheck, you should review the logic in the function `oppositeInnerConditionError` and ensure that the conditions involving `tok1` and `tok2` are consistent and aligned with the intended logic flow. Verify that the conditions are correctly structured and that any negations or opposite conditions are appropriately handled. Updating the conditions to remove any contradictions or inconsistencies will help in eliminating this warning and improving the overall quality and reliability of the codebase.

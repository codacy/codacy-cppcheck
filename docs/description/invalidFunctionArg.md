# Invalid func_name() argument nr 1. The value is 0 or 1 (boolean) but the valid values are '1:4'.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck error, identified by the ID "invalidFunctionArg", is designed to identify instances in the code where a function is called with an invalid argument. In the provided source context, the error is triggered when a function is called with a non-boolean argument, but the function expects a boolean value.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Ensuring that functions are called with the correct arguments is crucial for maintaining code quality and security. Passing incorrect types of arguments to functions can lead to unexpected behavior, runtime errors, memory corruption, or security vulnerabilities in the software. By detecting such issues early, developers can prevent potential bugs and security flaws in the codebase.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To resolve this issue, you should review the function calls that trigger the "invalidFunctionArg" error and ensure that the correct argument types are being passed to the functions. In the context of the provided code snippet, you should verify that functions expecting boolean arguments are indeed receiving boolean values. If a non-boolean value needs to be passed, you may need to refactor the code to handle this scenario appropriately, such as converting the value to a boolean or modifying the function's requirements. Additionally, consider updating the error message or documentation for clarity to help developers understand the expected argument types for the functions.

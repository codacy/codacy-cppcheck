# Comparison of a variable having boolean value using relational (<, >, <= or >=) operator.

1. This Cppcheck pattern named "comparisonOfBoolWithBoolError" looks for instances where a variable with a boolean value is being compared using relational operators (<, >, <=, >=) in the code. The error is raised when a boolean variable is involved in a comparison operation where such comparisons are not meaningful.

2. It matters for code quality and security because comparing boolean variables with relational operators can lead to unexpected behavior in the program. Boolean variables should typically be compared using logical operators (&&, ||, !) rather than relational operators. Using relational operators with boolean values can introduce bugs or logic errors that are hard to detect and can cause issues in the program's functionality.

3. To fix this issue, you should review the comparison operation involving boolean variables. If the intention is to check the truth value of the boolean variable, use logical operators like '==' or '!=' instead of relational operators. Ensure that the comparison logic aligns with the intended behavior of the program and that boolean variables are handled appropriately. By correcting these comparisons, you can improve the code's clarity, maintainability, and avoid potential issues related to incorrect boolean comparisons.

# Same expression used in consecutive assignments of 'x' and 'x'.

### 1. What this check looks for:
The `duplicateAssignExpression` check in Cppcheck looks for instances where the same expression is used in consecutive assignments of variables within the code. It specifically flags cases where the same value or expression is assigned to two different variables one after the other.

### 2. Why it matters for code quality/security:
Detecting and fixing duplicate assignments is important for maintaining code quality and ensuring code correctness. Such duplicate assignments can lead to confusion, increase the likelihood of bugs, and make the code harder to understand and maintain. In the context of security, duplicate assignments can introduce vulnerabilities or indicate a mistake that might lead to security risks in the software.

### 3. How to fix the issue:
To resolve the `duplicateAssignExpression` issue flagged by Cppcheck, review the code where the error is reported and ensure that each assignment to a variable is intended and necessary. If the same expression is meant to be assigned to multiple variables, consider consolidating the assignments or refactoring the code to make it clearer and more maintainable. If the duplicate assignment is indeed a mistake, correct it to assign the intended values to the respective variables. Regular code reviews and testing can help prevent such issues from creeping into the codebase.

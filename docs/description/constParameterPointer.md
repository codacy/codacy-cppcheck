# Parameter 'x' can be declared with const

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `constParameterCallback` check in Cppcheck looks for situations where a parameter in a function can be declared as `const`, but it seems that the parameter is actually a callback function. This check ensures that parameters are correctly annotated with `const` where applicable.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Ensuring that parameters are correctly marked as `const` when they are not modified within a function can improve code quality by providing clarity to the reader about the intent of the parameter. Additionally, marking parameters as `const` can help prevent unintentional modifications to the parameter within the function, which can lead to more predictable and robust code. This check can also help in maintaining code consistency and can potentially prevent bugs related to unintended modifications of parameters.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the `constParameterCallback` issue, you should review the function signature where the parameter is being flagged. If the parameter is indeed a callback function, it should not be declared as `const`. However, if the parameter is not intended to be a callback function and is just a regular parameter that is not modified within the function, then you can safely declare it as `const` to convey this immutability to other developers. Ensure that the parameter declaration aligns with its actual usage in the function to avoid confusion and potential bugs.

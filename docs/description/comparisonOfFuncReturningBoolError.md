# Comparison of a function returning boolean value using relational (<, >, <= or >=) operator.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck pattern, `comparisonOfFuncReturningBoolError`, detects instances where a function returning a boolean value is compared using relational operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`. This means that the result of a function call that returns a boolean value is being used in a way that may lead to unexpected behavior.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Comparing functions that return boolean values using relational operators can introduce bugs or logical errors in the code. The comparison of boolean values using relational operators is generally not meaningful as it may not provide the expected results. This can lead to code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and debug. In terms of security, such incorrect comparisons could potentially introduce vulnerabilities or lead to incorrect program behavior.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix this issue, you should review the code where the comparison is being made between functions returning boolean values. Instead of using relational operators to compare boolean results, consider revising the logic to ensure that the comparison is done correctly based on the actual boolean values returned by the functions. This might involve changing the comparison logic or re-evaluating the necessity of the comparison altogether. By ensuring that boolean values are compared appropriately, you can improve the clarity, correctness, and reliability of your code.

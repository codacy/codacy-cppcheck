# Ineffective call of function 'substr' because it returns a copy of the object. Use operator= instead.

1. The "uselessCallsSubstr" Cppcheck pattern looks for instances where a substring of a string is assigned to itself in a potentially inefficient manner. This can happen when using string manipulation functions like substr(), causing unnecessary memory allocations and copies.

2. It matters for code quality and performance optimization because inefficient use of substring operations can lead to unnecessary memory overhead and decreased performance. Inefficient substring assignments can result in extra memory allocations, copying of data, and increased runtime complexity, impacting the overall efficiency of the code.

3. To fix the issue highlighted by this pattern, consider using more efficient methods to manipulate strings such as resize(), replace(), erase(), or directly manipulating the string through its operators. By avoiding unnecessary substring operations, you can improve the performance of your code and reduce the likelihood of memory leaks or other performance issues. Additionally, reviewing and refactoring code to use more optimal string manipulation techniques can lead to cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code.

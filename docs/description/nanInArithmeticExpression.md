# Using NaN/Inf in a computation.

1. This Cppcheck pattern `nanInArithmeticExpression` looks for instances in the code where NaN (Not-a-Number) or Inf (Infinity) values are used in arithmetic expressions. In the provided code snippet, the function `CheckOther::checkNanInArithmeticExpression` iterates over tokens in the code and checks for division operations where the divisor is 0.0, which would result in a NaN value.

2. It matters for code quality and security because using NaN or Inf in arithmetic computations can lead to unexpected or incorrect results. While the computation may not crash the program, it can produce incorrect outputs, leading to subtle bugs that are hard to identify and debug. In some cases, such computations can also introduce vulnerabilities in the code, especially if the incorrect results are used in critical parts of the application.

3. To fix the issue highlighted by the `nanInArithmeticExpression` check, you should review the arithmetic expressions in your code and ensure that operations involving division by 0.0 or other operations that result in NaN or Inf values are handled properly. This may involve adding checks to avoid such computations, handling special cases separately, or validating input values to prevent invalid calculations. By ensuring that arithmetic expressions do not involve NaN or Inf values, you can improve the correctness and reliability of your code.

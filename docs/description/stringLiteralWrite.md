# Modifying string literal directly or indirectly is undefined behaviour.

1. This Cppcheck error pattern `stringLiteralWrite` looks for instances where the code is attempting to modify a string literal directly or indirectly. In the provided source code snippet, the error occurs when attempting to modify the `strValue` string, which is a string literal.

2. This check is crucial for code quality and security as modifying string literals can lead to undefined behavior. String literals are typically stored in read-only memory, and attempting to change them can result in memory corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. By identifying and fixing instances of modifying string literals, developers can prevent potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in their code.

3. To fix the issue, you should ensure that you are not attempting to modify string literals directly. Instead, if modification is required, use non-const variables or dynamically allocated memory to store and modify strings. In the provided code snippet, you can fix the issue by ensuring that `strValue` is not a string literal but a modifiable string object before attempting any modifications. By using proper string handling techniques and avoiding direct modifications of string literals, you can eliminate the `stringLiteralWrite` error and improve the code's reliability and security.

# Found function call inside sizeof().

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID `sizeofFunctionCall`, looks for instances where a function call is made inside the `sizeof()` operator. This is usually not intended as `sizeof()` is meant to return the size in bytes of its operand at compile time.

2. This check matters for code quality and security because using a function call inside `sizeof()` can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The size of a function call result is unknown at compile time, which can lead to issues with memory allocation, array sizing, or other calculations that rely on the size of the operand.

3. To fix this issue, you should refactor the code to avoid using a function call inside `sizeof()`. Instead, determine the size statically or use a different approach to achieve the desired functionality without relying on the size of a function call result. By doing so, you can ensure that the code is more predictable, maintainable, and less error-prone.

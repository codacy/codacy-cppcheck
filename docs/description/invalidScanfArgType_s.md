# %s in format string (no. 1) requires a 'char *' but the argument type is Unknown.

### 1. What this check looks for:
This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID "invalidScanfArgType_s", looks for instances where the argument type passed to a `scanf` function does not match the format specifier in the format string. Specifically, it focuses on cases where a format specifier expects a string pointer (`%s` or `%S`), but the argument provided is not a pointer to a character or wide character.

### 2. Why it matters for code quality/security:
Ensuring that the argument types match the format specifiers in functions like `scanf` is crucial for code quality and security. Mismatched format specifiers and argument types can lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. By detecting and addressing these issues, the code becomes more robust, reliable, and less prone to security vulnerabilities.

### 3. How to fix the issue:
To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the argument passed to the `scanf` function corresponds correctly to the format specifier used in the format string. Specifically, when encountering a `%s` or `%S` specifier, the argument should be a pointer to a character array or wide character array, respectively. 

You can address this by:
- Reviewing the format specifiers and corresponding arguments in the `scanf` function calls.
- Ensuring that pointers to character arrays are provided when `%s` or `%S` specifiers are used.
- Make necessary adjustments to the code to guarantee that the argument types match the expected format specifiers.

By following these steps and correcting any mismatches between format specifiers and argument types in `scanf` calls, you can resolve the "invalidScanfArgType_s" Cppcheck error and improve the quality and security of your codebase.

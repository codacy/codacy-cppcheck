# Exception thrown in function declared not to throw exceptions.

1. **What this check looks for**:
   The `throwInNoexceptFunction` check in Cppcheck looks for instances where an exception is thrown within a function that is declared using the `noexcept` specifier, indicating that the function is not supposed to throw any exceptions. This error is flagged when code violates this constraint.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security**:
   Ensuring that functions accurately declare their exception specifications is crucial for code reliability, maintainability, and security. When a function is marked as `noexcept`, it implies that the function is not expected to throw exceptions. Violating this declaration by allowing exceptions to be thrown can lead to unexpected behavior, potentially causing program crashes, resource leaks, or other issues that can compromise the stability and security of the software.

3. **How to fix the issue**:
   To resolve the `throwInNoexceptFunction` error identified by Cppcheck, you should review the function where the error occurs and ensure that it adheres to its exception specification. If the function is declared as `noexcept`, make sure that no exceptions are thrown within it. If exceptions need to be handled, consider either removing the `noexcept` specifier from the function declaration or adding proper exception handling mechanisms to handle the exceptions within the function without propagating them further. By aligning the function's behavior with its declared exception specification, you can improve the code's correctness and robustness.

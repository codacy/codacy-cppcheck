# The file 'tmp' is opened for read and write access at the same time on different streams

1. This Cppcheck error implementation checks for situations where a file is being opened for both read and write access at the same time on different streams.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because opening a file for both reading and writing simultaneously on different streams can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or file access conflicts. Such scenarios can introduce bugs, security vulnerabilities, or result in incorrect program behavior.

3. To fix the issue, ensure that when opening a file, it is opened either in read mode or write mode, but not both simultaneously on different streams. Check the code that opens the file and make sure that the file is opened with the appropriate access mode based on the intended operations. Avoid scenarios where the same file is opened for reading and writing concurrently on different streams to prevent potential issues related to file access and data integrity.

# Mismatching allocation and deallocation: varname

1. This Cppcheck error implementation is for the "invalidFree" check. It looks for cases where there is a mismatch in the way memory is deallocated (freed or deleted) compared to how it was allocated (new or new()). The error message indicates that the address being freed or deleted is not matching the allocation operation.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because mismatched memory allocation and deallocation can lead to memory leaks, undefined behavior, or crashes in the program. If memory is not deallocated properly or if there are inconsistencies in how memory is managed, it can introduce vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers.

3. To fix the issue identified by the "invalidFree" check, you need to review the allocation and deallocation operations in your code to ensure they are consistent. Make sure that memory allocated using "new" is deallocated using "delete" and memory allocated using "new[]" is deallocated using "delete[]". If the allocation operation is conditionally modified (like adding parentheses), ensure that the deallocation operation reflects the same modification. Additionally, consider using smart pointers or RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) to automatically manage memory and avoid manual memory management errors.

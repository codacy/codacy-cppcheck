# Instance of 'varname' object is destroyed immediately.

### 1. What this check looks for
This Cppcheck pattern, identified by the error ID `unusedScopedObject`, flags instances where a scoped object is created and destroyed immediately within the same block of code. The specific error message generated for this pattern includes the name of the object (`$symbol`) that is being unused.

### 2. Why it matters for code quality/security
Detecting and addressing unused scoped objects is essential for maintaining code quality and improving efficiency. When objects are created and destroyed unnecessarily within the same scope, it can lead to performance overhead and unnecessary memory usage. Additionally, such constructs can indicate potential logical errors or suboptimal design choices in the code.

From a security perspective, leaving unused objects in the code can potentially introduce vulnerabilities if sensitive data is not properly handled or if the objects are not cleaned up correctly. Code that follows best practices for resource management and object usage is less likely to have hidden bugs or vulnerabilities.

### 3. How to fix the issue
To address the issue flagged by the `unusedScopedObject` error, consider the following steps:
- Review the code to identify the scoped object that is being created and destroyed immediately.
- Determine if the object is truly necessary in that particular scope. If not, consider removing the object creation altogether.
- If the object serves a purpose but is being created and destroyed too frequently, evaluate if the object can be reused or its scope can be extended to improve efficiency.
- Refactor the code to ensure that objects are created and destroyed only when necessary, optimizing resource usage and improving code readability.

By addressing unused scoped objects, developers can enhance code quality, improve performance, and reduce the likelihood of introducing security vulnerabilities due to improper resource management.

# 'operator=' should return reference to 'this' instance.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation with the ID `operatorEqRetRefThis` checks for cases where the `operator=` overload in a C++ class does not return a reference to the current instance (i.e., `this`). 

2. Returning a reference to `this` in the `operator=` overload is considered a common best practice in C++ programming. This practice ensures that the assignment operator behaves consistently with other assignment operators and avoids unnecessary object copying. Failing to return a reference to `this` can lead to unexpected behavior, inefficiency, and potential bugs in the code.

3. To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck error, make sure that the `operator=` overload in your C++ class returns a reference to the current instance. Here is an example of how to modify the `operator=` overload to return a reference to `this`:

```cpp
ClassName& operator=(const ClassName& other) {
    // Copy member variables from 'other' to 'this'
    // Return a reference to 'this' instance
    return *this;
}
```

By following this pattern and returning a reference to `this` in the `operator=` overload, you can improve the clarity, efficiency, and correctness of your C++ code.

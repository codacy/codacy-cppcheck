# Signed 'char' type used as array index.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The Cppcheck rule 'signedCharArrayIndex' detects the use of a signed 'char' type as an array index in the source code.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Using a signed 'char' type as an array index can lead to potential issues related to buffer underflow due to sign extension. In C++, a 'char' type can be signed or unsigned, and if it is signed, it can hold values between -128 and 127. When used as an array index, if the value exceeds 127, it can cause unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities in the code.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address this issue and ensure code quality and security:
   - Avoid using signed 'char' types as array indices. Instead, consider using 'int' or 'size_t' for array indices to ensure consistency and avoid potential issues related to signed 'char' types.
   - If the use of 'char' is necessary for indexing and its value may exceed 127, consider explicitly casting it to an 'int' or 'size_t' before using it as an array index to prevent any unintended behavior due to sign extension.
   - Review the code where signed 'char' types are used as array indices and refactor it to use appropriate data types to ensure clarity, maintainability, and security of the codebase.

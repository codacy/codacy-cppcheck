# Same expression on both sides of '&&'.

1. This Cppcheck check, identified as "oppositeExpression", looks for instances where the same expression appears on both sides of a logical operator (e.g., '&&', '||'). 

2. This check is crucial for code quality and security as having opposite expressions on both sides of a logical operator can lead to logical errors or unintended behavior in the code. It could indicate a mistake such as a copy-paste error or a misunderstanding of the logical conditions. Identifying and fixing these instances can help prevent bugs, improve code readability, and ensure that the code behaves as intended.

3. To fix the issue flagged by this Cppcheck check, you should carefully review the logical expression where the error is reported. Check if the same expression or opposite expressions are unintentionally repeated on both sides of the logical operator ('&&', '||'). Make sure that the logical conditions are correctly structured and that the intended logic is properly implemented. Rework the expression if needed to ensure that the logic is clear and accurate.

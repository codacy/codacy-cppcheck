# Comparison of a boolean expression with an integer other than 0 or 1.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation "compareBoolExpressionWithInt" checks for instances where a boolean expression is being compared with an integer value in the code.

2. It matters for code quality and security because comparing a boolean expression with an integer can lead to unexpected behavior and potential bugs in the code. In some cases, it can also indicate logical errors or incorrect assumptions in the code logic, which may introduce vulnerabilities or make the code difficult to maintain.

3. To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck warning, you should review the code where the comparison is being made between a boolean expression and an integer. Ensure that the comparison is valid and makes logical sense. If the intention was to compare with boolean values (true/false or 0/1), make sure that the comparison is done correctly using boolean operators (e.g., && for logical AND, || for logical OR). If the comparison is supposed to involve integer values, consider revising the code logic to handle integer comparisons appropriately without mixing boolean expressions.

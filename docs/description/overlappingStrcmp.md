# The expression 'strcmp(x,"def") != 0' is suspicious. It overlaps 'strcmp(x,"abc") == 0'.

1. The overlappingStrcmp Cppcheck pattern looks for cases where two strcmp (string comparison) expressions are used in a way that they overlap in a suspicious manner. The check specifically analyzes the expressions passed to strcmp and detects potential overlaps between them.

2. This check matters for code quality and security because overlapping strcmp expressions can lead to unintended behavior or errors in the program. If two strcmp expressions overlap, it can result in unexpected comparison results, potentially leading to logic errors, incorrect program behavior, or security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or data corruption.

3. To fix the issue identified by the overlappingStrcmp Cppcheck pattern, you should review the strcmp expressions in your code and ensure that they do not overlap in a way that might cause confusion or errors. Consider revising the logic or structure of the code to avoid overlapping strcmp expressions. Additionally, you can refactor the code to make the comparison logic clearer and less error-prone. It is important to analyze the context in which strcmp is used and ensure that the comparisons are distinct and do not interfere with each other.

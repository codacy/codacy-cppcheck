# Comparison of a boolean value using relational operator (<, >, <= or >=).

1. This Cppcheck error implementation checks for instances where a boolean value is compared using relational operators (<, >, <=, or >=).

2. It is important for code quality and security because comparing boolean values with relational operators can lead to unexpected behavior and logical errors in the code. The result of such comparisons may not be as intended, potentially causing the program to behave incorrectly or produce incorrect results. In some cases, it may also introduce vulnerabilities or bugs in the software.

3. To fix this issue, ensure that boolean values are not compared using relational operators. Instead, use logical operators (&&, ||, !) for boolean comparisons. If the comparison is necessary for a specific case, consider revising the logic to avoid comparing boolean values with relational operators. Additionally, review the code logic to ensure that the comparisons are done correctly and the expected results are achieved without risking unexpected behavior.

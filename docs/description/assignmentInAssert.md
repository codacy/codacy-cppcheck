# Assert statement modifies 'var'.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID "assignmentInAssert", looks for instances where an assignment operation or increment/decrement operation is performed on a variable inside an assert statement. The check aims to flag situations where modifications to variables occur within assert statements, which may lead to unexpected behavior in release builds where assert statements are typically disabled.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because variables modified within assert statements may not behave as expected in release builds, potentially leading to undetected bugs or vulnerabilities. Assert statements are commonly used for debugging purposes and are disabled in release builds to improve performance. Modroducing side effects within assert statements can result in code that behaves differently in development and production environments, making it harder to identify and fix issues.

3. To fix the issue flagged by this Cppcheck error, developers should avoid performing assignments or modifications to variables within assert statements. Instead, separate the logic that modifies variables from the assert statements to ensure that the code behaves consistently across different build configurations. By refactoring the code to remove variable modifications from assert statements, developers can improve code reliability and maintainability.

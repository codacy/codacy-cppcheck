# The class 'class' defines member variable with name 'variable' also defined in its parent class 'class'.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `duplInheritedMember` Cppcheck pattern looks for cases where a derived class defines a member that has the same name as a member in its parent class. This duplication of member names can lead to confusion and potential issues during code execution.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Ensuring that class members have unique names within an inheritance hierarchy is important for maintaining code clarity, readability, and maintainability. Having duplicate member names can introduce ambiguity, make the code harder to understand, and potentially lead to unintended consequences during runtime. It can also violate the principle of encapsulation and may indicate a design flaw in the code.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To resolve the `duplInheritedMember` issue identified by Cppcheck, you should review the definitions of the derived class and its parent class to identify the duplicated member names. To fix the problem, you can rename one of the duplicated members to make them distinct within the inheritance hierarchy. By giving each member a unique and descriptive name, you can prevent naming conflicts and improve the clarity and maintainability of your code.

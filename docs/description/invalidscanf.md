# scanf() without field width limits can crash with huge input data.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation with Error ID "invalidscanf" looks for instances where the `scanf` function is used without specifying a field width limit in the format string.

2. This check is crucial for code quality and security because using `scanf` without specifying a field width limit can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. If the input data provided during `scanf` exceeds the size of the buffer allocated for storing the input, it can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially causing the program to crash or allowing malicious attackers to execute arbitrary code.

3. To fix this issue, developers should always specify a field width limit in the format string of `scanf` to ensure that the input data fits within the allocated buffer size. For example, instead of using `scanf("%s", c);`, developers should use `scanf("%4s", c);` to specify that only up to 4 characters (excluding the null terminator) should be read into the buffer `c`. This practice helps prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities and ensures the safe handling of input data.

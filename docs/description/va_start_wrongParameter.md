# 'arg1' given to va_start() is not last named argument of the function. Did you intend to pass 'arg2'?

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID "va_list_usedBeforeStarted", checks for instances where a `va_list` variable is used before `va_start()` was called to initialize it. 

2. It matters for both code quality and security because using a `va_list` variable before it is properly initialized can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities in the program. When `va_start()` is not called before using a `va_list`, the behavior of functions like `va_arg()` becomes unpredictable, potentially leading to memory access violations or other serious issues. Ensuring that `va_list` variables are correctly initialized and used according to the C standard is crucial for the stability and security of the codebase.

3. To fix the issue, you need to make sure that any `va_list` variable is properly initialized using `va_start()` before it is used. This involves calling `va_start()` with the `va_list` variable as an argument before any calls to `va_arg()` or other `va_*` functions that operate on the variable. By following this practice, you can ensure that the `va_list` variable is in a valid state for processing variadic arguments, avoiding potential runtime errors and security vulnerabilities in the code.

# Same iterator is used with different containers 'container0' and 'container1'.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID "iterators2", checks for situations where the same iterator is used with different containers in C++ code. It specifically identifies cases where the same iterator is being used to iterate over different containers within the same scope.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Using the same iterator to iterate over multiple containers can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the program. It can result in incorrect data processing, unexpected values, or even undefined behavior. This issue is particularly critical for code quality and security because it can introduce bugs that are hard to detect and may lead to vulnerabilities in the software.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address this issue and improve code quality and security:
   - Review the code where the error is reported and identify the places where the same iterator is used with different containers.
   - Ensure that each iterator is associated with a specific container and is not reused for iterating over multiple containers.
   - If necessary, create separate iterators for each container to avoid mixing them up.
   - Check the scope and lifetime of the iterators to ensure they are valid for the duration of the iteration over the corresponding container.
   - Refactor the code if needed to separate the logic for iterating over different containers with distinct iterators.
   - Test the modified code thoroughly to verify that the issue has been resolved and that the program behaves as expected without using the same iterator for different containers.

# Used file that is not opened.

1. The "useClosedFile" Cppcheck pattern looks for instances in the code where a file is being used without first being opened. This can occur when attempting to read from or write to a file that has not been properly opened using file handling functions in C++.

2. This check is crucial for code quality and security as attempting to use a file that has not been opened can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or potential security vulnerabilities. Operating on a file that is not open can result in data corruption, loss of information, or even expose the application to attacks such as file manipulation or unauthorized access.

3. To fix the issue identified by the "useClosedFile" Cppcheck pattern, ensure that all file operations are performed on files that have been correctly opened using functions like `std::ifstream::open()` for reading, `std::ofstream::open()` for writing, or `std::fstream::open()` for both reading and writing. Always check the return value of the file open operation to ensure that the file was successfully opened before proceeding with any read or write operations. Additionally, make sure to close the file using `close()` or the file stream destructor after finishing all operations to avoid resource leaks. By following these best practices, you can prevent errors related to using closed files and improve the overall robustness and security of your code.

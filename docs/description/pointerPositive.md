# A pointer can not be negative so it is either pointless or an error to check if it is not.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation named "Pointer positive" checks for situations in the code where there is a comparison or check performed to determine if a pointer is not negative. Since pointers in C++ cannot have negative values, such a check is considered unnecessary or indicative of a potential error.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because unnecessary pointer checks not only clutter the code but also indicate a lack of understanding of how pointers work in C++. Redundant pointer checks can make the code harder to read and maintain, leading to potential bugs or unintended behavior. Additionally, if a programmer mistakenly assumes that a pointer can be negative, it might result in logic errors or vulnerabilities in the code.

3. To fix this issue identified by the "Pointer positive" check, you should review the code segment where the pointer comparison is being made. Ensure that the comparison is necessary and remove it if it is redundant due to the nature of pointers in C++. By eliminating unnecessary pointer checks, you can improve the readability, maintainability, and reliability of the code.

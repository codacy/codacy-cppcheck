# Result of operator '|' is always true if one operand is non-zero. Did you intend to use '&'?

1. The "badBitmaskCheck" Cppcheck pattern looks for instances where the bitwise OR operator '|' is used with one operand being equal to zero. This is considered redundant because when one operand is zero, the result of the OR operation will always be the non-zero operand itself.

2. This check matters for code quality and potentially security because using a redundant operator can lead to confusion for developers reading the code. It can also indicate a mistake in the logic of the program. In some cases, mistakenly using '|' instead of '&' can lead to unintended behavior in the program, potentially introducing bugs or vulnerabilities.

3. To fix the issue identified by the "badBitmaskCheck" pattern, you should review the code where the bitwise OR operator '|' is being used. If one of the operands is known to be zero, consider whether the intention was to use the bitwise AND operator '&' instead. Correct the expression to use the appropriate operator based on the intended logic of the program. This will not only improve the readability of the code but also ensure that the bitwise operations are correctly implemented according to the intended logic.

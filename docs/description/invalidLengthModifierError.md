# 'I' in format string (no. 1) is a length modifier and cannot be used without a conversion specifier.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck pattern named `invalidLengthModifierError` detects instances where a length modifier is used without a conversion specifier in a format string. The error is reported when constructing an error message. It checks for situations where a length modifier, such as `%h`, `%l`, or `%ll`, is present in the format string but is not followed by a valid conversion specifier like `%d`, `%s`, or `%f`.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   This check is essential for code quality and security because using length modifiers without conversion specifiers can lead to undefined behavior, unexpected output, or even security vulnerabilities. When a length modifier is incorrectly used in a format string, it can cause the program to interpret the following arguments incorrectly, leading to memory corruption issues like buffer overflows or reading uninitialized memory. By detecting and fixing these errors, the code becomes more robust, reliable, and less susceptible to potential security risks associated with format string vulnerabilities.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To resolve this issue, ensure that every length modifier in a format string is followed by a proper conversion specifier that matches the expected data type of the corresponding argument. Review the format strings in the codebase and verify that each length modifier is correctly paired with a conversion specifier. Make necessary corrections to align the length modifiers and conversion specifiers appropriately to avoid any ambiguity or undefined behavior during formatting and output operations. Conduct thorough testing to validate the changes and ensure that the format strings are used correctly throughout the code.

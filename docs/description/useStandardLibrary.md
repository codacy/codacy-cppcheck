# Consider using memcpy instead of loop.

1. **What this check looks for**:
   This Cppcheck pattern `useStandardLibrary` checks for instances in the code where a custom implementation is used instead of utilizing standard library functions for certain operations. In the given code snippet, the check looks for places where a loop is used to perform a task that could be achieved more efficiently and safely using a standard library function.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security**:
   Using standard library functions instead of reinventing the wheel with custom implementations can greatly improve code quality and security. Standard library functions are typically well-tested, optimized, and designed to handle edge cases and potential vulnerabilities. By relying on standard library functions, developers can benefit from code that is more reliable, maintainable, and less prone to bugs or security vulnerabilities introduced by custom implementations.

3. **How to fix the issue**:
   To address this issue flagged by the `useStandardLibrary` check, developers should refactor the code to replace the custom loop with the appropriate standard library function. In the given context, it suggests replacing the custom loop with a standard library function that achieves the same result. This can involve identifying the specific standard library function that corresponds to the custom logic being implemented and using it instead. By following the suggestion to "Consider using [expected] instead of loop", developers can improve the code by leveraging the robustness and efficiency provided by standard library functions.

# Same expression in both branches of ternary operator.

1. The `duplicateValueTernary` Cppcheck pattern looks for instances where the same value or expression is used in both branches of a ternary operator. This means that regardless of the condition, the same code will be executed in both cases, which may indicate a logical error or unnecessary complexity in the code.

2. This check is important for code quality and potentially security because having the same value in both branches of a ternary operator can lead to confusion for developers maintaining the code. It can make the code harder to understand, increase the risk of introducing bugs during modifications, and potentially hide logical errors or unintended behavior. In some cases, such patterns could lead to vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.

3. To fix the issue identified by the `duplicateValueTernary` pattern, you should review the ternary operator and ensure that different values or expressions are used in the true and false branches to reflect the intended logic. If the same value or expression is indeed intended, consider refactoring the code to make it clearer or using a different construct that better conveys the logic being implemented. By addressing this issue, you can improve the readability, maintainability, and reliability of the codebase.

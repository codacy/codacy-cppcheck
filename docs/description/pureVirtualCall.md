# Call of pure virtual function 'f' in constructor.

1. This Cppcheck error `virtualCallInConstructor` checks for instances where a virtual function is called within a constructor. 

2. This check is crucial for code quality and security because calling virtual functions in constructors can lead to unexpected behavior due to the way object construction and initialization work in C++. When a virtual function is called in a constructor, the dynamic binding mechanism may not work as expected, potentially causing issues like slicing, undefined behavior, or incorrect behavior due to the object not being fully constructed yet. This can lead to bugs that are hard to diagnose and fix, impacting the reliability and maintainability of the code. 

3. To fix this issue, it is recommended to avoid calling virtual functions or performing any operations that rely on dynamic binding within constructors. Instead, consider redesigning the code to defer such operations to initialization functions or use alternative design patterns like the Factory Method pattern. By separating object construction and initialization from dynamic behavior, you can ensure that the object is fully constructed and initialized before any virtual functions are called, preventing potential issues related to virtual function calls in constructors.

# The function '' overrides a function in a base class but is not marked with a 'override' specifier.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, with the Error ID "missingOverride", looks for cases where a function in a derived class overrides a function in a base class but is not marked with the 'override' specifier.

2. This check is important for code quality and maintainability. When a function in a derived class is intended to override a function in a base class, it is good practice to explicitly mark it with the 'override' specifier. This not only clearly communicates the intention to other developers but also helps prevent accidental errors or discrepancies in the codebase. By using the 'override' specifier, the compiler can provide better error checking and ensure that the intended overriding behavior is correctly implemented.

3. To fix the issue identified by this check, you should explicitly mark the overriding functions in the derived class with the 'override' specifier. This can be done by adding the keyword 'override' after the function declaration in the derived class. By doing so, you explicitly indicate that the function is intended to override a virtual function from the base class, making the code clearer and more robust. Here is an example of how to fix the code snippet provided:

```cpp
void CheckClass::uselessOverrideError(const Function *funcInBase, const Function *funcInDerived, bool isSameCode) override
{
    // Function implementation here
}
```

By adding the 'override' specifier to the function declaration in the derived class, you address the issue identified by the Cppcheck error and improve the code quality and maintainability of your C++ codebase.

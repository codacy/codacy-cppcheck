# Iterating over container 'var' that is always empty.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck pattern, identified by the error ID `knownEmptyContainer`, is designed to detect situations in C++ code where a container (such as a vector, list, or map) is being iterated over or used with a specific algorithm, but the container is known to be empty at compile time. The detection is based on analyzing the values stored in the container and determining if it is empty or not.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Identifying and fixing instances where code operates on empty containers unnecessarily can lead to improved code quality and potentially enhance security. Iterating over or performing operations on empty containers can introduce inefficiencies into the codebase, impacting performance. Moreover, if the code logic assumes the container is not empty and does not handle the empty case properly, it can lead to runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or vulnerabilities.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address this issue and improve code quality, you should review the logic surrounding the usage of the container in question. Here are some steps to consider:
   - Check if the container is indeed expected to be empty in the context where it is being used. If it is not supposed to be empty, investigate why it is empty and address the underlying cause.
   - Ensure that appropriate checks are in place to handle empty containers gracefully. This may involve adding conditional statements to skip operations when the container is empty, or providing default values or alternative logic to handle the empty case.
   - If the container is guaranteed to be empty at compile time, consider refactoring the code to eliminate unnecessary operations on the empty container. This can help improve code readability and maintainability.
   - Regularly review and test the code to verify that it behaves as intended, especially when dealing with container operations that could involve empty containers.

By addressing the `knownEmptyContainer` issue in your codebase, you can enhance the robustness, performance, and security of your C++ applications.

# Suspicious assignment in condition. Condition 'x=y' is always true.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `assignmentInCondition` check implemented in Cppcheck looks for suspicious assignments within conditions. It flags instances where an assignment operation is used within a conditional statement, which can lead to potentially unintended behavior or coding mistakes.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Detecting and correcting assignments within conditions is crucial for maintaining code quality and security. Assignments in conditions can introduce bugs, make the code harder to read and understand, and potentially lead to logical errors. Additionally, such constructs can be confusing to other developers reviewing the code, and may indicate poor coding practices that could introduce vulnerabilities or bugs into the software.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the `assignmentInCondition` issue identified by Cppcheck, you should refactor the conditional statements to separate the assignment operation from the condition. Instead of assigning a value within the condition, perform the assignment before the condition and then evaluate the result in the condition. This will ensure that the intent of the code is clear and reduce the likelihood of unintended consequences.

   For example, instead of:
   ```cpp
   if (x = y) {
       // Code block
   }
   ```
   Refactor it to:
   ```cpp
   x = y;
   if (x) {
       // Code block
   }
   ```
   By making this change, you clarify the logic of the code and prevent any potential issues related to assignments within conditions.

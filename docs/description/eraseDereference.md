# Invalid iterator 'iter' used.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `eraseIteratorOutOfBounds` check in Cppcheck looks for instances where the `erase()` function is called on an iterator that is out of bounds. This typically occurs when trying to erase an element from a container using an iterator that points beyond the valid range of elements in the container.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   This check is important for code quality and security because attempting to erase an element using an out-of-bounds iterator can lead to undefined behavior, such as memory corruption, crashes, or unexpected program behavior. It can introduce bugs that are difficult to trace and potentially open up vulnerabilities in the codebase.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the `eraseIteratorOutOfBounds` issue identified by Cppcheck, you should ensure that the iterator used with the `erase()` function points to a valid element within the container before calling `erase()`. You can do this by checking if the iterator is valid before attempting to erase the element. Here's an example of how you can add a check to ensure the iterator is within the valid range:

   ```cpp
   if (itertok != container.end()) {
       container.erase(itertok);
   } else {
       // Handle the case where the iterator is out of bounds
       // For example, throw an exception or log an error message
   }
   ```
   By adding this check, you can prevent errors caused by attempting to erase elements using out-of-bounds iterators, improving the reliability and security of your code.

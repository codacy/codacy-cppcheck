# No 'return' statement in non-void function causes undefined behavior.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID operatorEqMissingReturnStatement, looks for situations where a non-void function does not have a 'return' statement. In this specific case, it targets the assignment operator '=' function that is missing a 'return' statement.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because omitting the 'return' statement in a non-void function can lead to undefined behavior. In the context of an assignment operator, not returning a reference to the current instance ('this') can introduce bugs or unexpected behavior in the program. Such issues can potentially result in memory leaks, data corruption, or vulnerabilities in the software.

3. To fix the issue flagged by this Cppcheck error, you should ensure that the assignment operator '=' function explicitly returns a reference to the current instance. This can be achieved by adding a 'return *this;' statement at the end of the assignment operator function implementation. By doing so, you clarify the intent of the function and prevent any potential issues related to undefined behavior or incorrect memory management.

# Either the condition is redundant or there is pointer arithmetic with NULL pointer.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `nullPointerRedundantCheck` Cppcheck pattern looks for redundant null pointer checks in the code. It specifically identifies situations where a null pointer check is performed on a pointer that has already been dereferenced without a null check, making the subsequent null check unnecessary.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Redundant null pointer checks can clutter the codebase, making it harder to read and maintain. They can also introduce unnecessary performance overhead by executing redundant checks. From a security perspective, such redundancy can lead to confusion and potential oversight, increasing the risk of overlooking genuine null pointer issues that may be critical for application stability and security.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address the `nullPointerRedundantCheck` warning, review the code logic to ensure that null pointer dereference checks are performed at appropriate points where the pointer may actually be null. Remove any redundant null checks that follow dereferencing operations on the same pointer. Refactor the code to handle null pointer cases efficiently without introducing unnecessary redundancy. By eliminating redundant null pointer checks, the codebase becomes cleaner, more readable, and potentially more performant.

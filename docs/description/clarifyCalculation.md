# Clarify calculation precedence for '+' and '?'.

1. This Cppcheck check, identified by the error ID `clarifyCalculation`, looks for suspicious calculations in C++ code where the precedence of operators may not be clear. Specifically, it focuses on expressions involving the ternary conditional operator `? :`.

2. Clarifying calculation precedence is important for code quality and potentially security because ambiguous or unclear expressions can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program. In C++, operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Failure to clearly define the precedence can result in unintended outcomes and make the code difficult to understand and maintain. In the context of security, unclear calculations can introduce vulnerabilities or logical errors that may be exploited by malicious actors.

3. To address the `clarifyCalculation` issue flagged by Cppcheck, the recommended approach is to use parentheses to explicitly specify the intended order of operations in the expression involving the conditional operator `? :`. The check suggests two alternative ways to clarify the calculation:
   - Recommended calculation #1: Wrap the expression `(a + op + b)` with parentheses before the ternary operator: `'(a + op + b) ? c : d'`.
   - Recommended calculation #2: Wrap the expression `(b ? c : d)` with parentheses after the operator `op`: `'a + op + (b ? c : d)'`.
   By adding parentheses in the appropriate places, the code becomes more readable, unambiguous, and less prone to errors, enhancing code quality and potentially improving security by avoiding unexpected behavior caused by operator precedence ambiguity.

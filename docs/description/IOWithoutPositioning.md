# Read and write operations without a call to a positioning function (fseek, fsetpos or rewind) or fflush in between result in undefined behaviour.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the error ID "IOWithoutPositioning", looks for instances where read and write operations are performed on a file without a call to a positioning function (such as fseek, fsetpos, or rewind) or fflush in between. This is a potential issue that can lead to undefined behavior in the program.

2. It matters for code quality and security because performing read and write operations on a file without proper positioning or flushing can cause unexpected behavior in the program. This can result in data corruption, incorrect output, or other unintended consequences, which can impact the reliability and security of the software. By highlighting this issue, Cppcheck helps developers identify and rectify potential sources of errors in file handling operations.

3. To fix this issue, you should ensure that whenever you perform read or write operations on a file, you include a call to a positioning function (such as fseek, fsetpos, or rewind) to set the file pointer to the desired location before the operation. Additionally, if needed, you should also include a call to fflush to flush any buffered data to the file before switching between read and write operations. By following these best practices, you can avoid undefined behavior and ensure the correct handling of file operations in your C++ code.

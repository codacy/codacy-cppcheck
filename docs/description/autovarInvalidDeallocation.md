# Deallocation of an auto-variable results in undefined behaviour.

### 1. What this check looks for
This Cppcheck error implementation targets instances where the program uses a variable or object that has a lifetime that is either out of scope or invalid when returning. The specific error IDs for these cases are "invalidLifetime" and "returnDanglingLifetime".

### 2. Why it matters for code quality/security
Identifying and addressing invalid or dangling lifetime issues is crucial for maintaining code quality and security. Using variables or objects with invalid lifetimes can lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or security vulnerabilities. These issues can be difficult to diagnose and can result in hard-to-find bugs or exploitable vulnerabilities in the software.

### 3. How to fix the issue
To fix the issue, ensure that variables and objects are used within their valid lifetime scope. This may involve:
- Checking the scope and lifetime of variables and objects to ensure they are valid when used.
- Avoiding returning or using references to variables that have gone out of scope.
- Implementing proper memory management techniques such as using smart pointers or ensuring proper object ownership.

By addressing these invalid and dangling lifetime issues, you can improve the stability, reliability, and security of your codebase.

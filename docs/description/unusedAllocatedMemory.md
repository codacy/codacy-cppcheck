# Variable 'varname' is allocated memory that is never used.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck error implementation targets the detection of allocated memory that is never used in the codebase. Specifically, the `unusedAllocatedMemory` error is raised when a variable is allocated memory using dynamic memory allocation functions like `new` or `malloc`, but the allocated memory is never accessed or utilized in the program.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Identifying and addressing unused allocated memory is crucial for maintaining good code quality and improving security. Unused allocated memory can lead to memory leaks, where memory is allocated but not properly deallocated, causing the program to consume more memory over time and potentially leading to performance issues or crashes. Additionally, leaving allocated memory unused can introduce potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or data corruption if the memory is inadvertently accessed or modified by other parts of the program.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To resolve the `unusedAllocatedMemory` error and improve code quality/security, you should review the code where the error is reported and determine if the allocated memory is indeed unnecessary. If the allocated memory is not needed, you should deallocate it using the appropriate deallocation function (e.g., `delete` for C++ objects allocated with `new`, `free` for memory allocated with `malloc`). Alternatively, if the allocated memory is intended to be used but is mistakenly left unused, you should refactor the code to utilize the allocated memory as intended. By properly managing allocated memory, you can prevent memory leaks, improve resource utilization, and enhance the overall robustness of your codebase.

# Modulo of one is always equal to zero

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, with Error ID "moduloofone", looks for instances in the code where the modulo operation (%) is being applied with the divisor being 1. 

2. It matters for code quality as performing a modulo operation with the divisor as 1 will always result in the remainder being 0. This can indicate a potential mistake or unnecessary operation in the code, leading to confusion for developers and potentially impacting the efficiency of the code. While not a security issue, it can contribute to code readability and maintainability concerns.

3. To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck error, you should review the code where the modulo operation is being performed and ensure that the divisor is not hardcoded as 1. If the intention was to perform a modulo operation with a different divisor, make sure to correct the divisor value accordingly. If the modulo operation with a divisor of 1 is indeed intentional, consider adding a comment to explain the reasoning behind it to improve code clarity.

# Ineffective call of function 'empty()'. Did you intend to call 'clear()' instead?

1. The "uselessCallsConstructor" check in Cppcheck looks for instances where a container is inefficiently assigned a partial copy of itself using a constructor. This can lead to performance issues as unnecessary copies are made, impacting the efficiency of the code.

2. This check matters for code quality and performance optimization. Inefficient constructor calls can lead to unnecessary memory allocations and copies, resulting in slower execution times and increased memory usage. Identifying and fixing these instances can help improve the overall performance of the codebase.

3. To fix the issue identified by the "uselessCallsConstructor" check, consider using more efficient methods such as `erase()` or `resize()` instead of assigning a partial copy of the container to itself using a constructor. By using appropriate methods for modifying containers, unnecessary copies can be avoided, leading to better performance and more optimized code.

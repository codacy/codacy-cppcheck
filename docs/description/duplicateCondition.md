# The if condition is the same as the previous if condition

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `duplicateCondition` Cppcheck pattern checks for duplicate or redundant conditional statements within the code. In the provided source context, the error is raised when two conditions (`cond1` and `cond2`) are found to be duplicates of each other.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Identifying and eliminating duplicate conditions is important for maintaining code quality and readability. Redundant conditions can lead to confusion, increase code complexity, and make it harder to maintain and debug the code. From a security perspective, redundant conditions may introduce unnecessary branching logic that can potentially introduce logic errors or vulnerabilities in the code.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the `duplicateCondition` issue, you need to review the logic in the code to determine why `cond1` and `cond2` are duplicates of each other. Depending on the intent of the conditions, you may need to refactor the logic to remove the redundancy. This could involve consolidating the conditions, revising the control flow, or re-evaluating the necessity of one of the conditions. Once the duplicate conditions are addressed, the error should no longer be triggered by Cppcheck.

# Same iterator is used with containers 'container' that are temporaries or defined in different scopes.

1. The "iterators3" Cppcheck pattern looks for instances where the same iterator is used with different containers in C++ code. This is flagged when the same iterator is used to iterate over multiple containers, potentially leading to unintended behavior or errors in the program.

2. This check is important for ensuring code quality and security in C++ programs. Using the same iterator with different containers can result in unexpected behavior, such as accessing invalid memory locations, causing segmentation faults, or producing incorrect results. This can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to detect and debug, leading to potential vulnerabilities or instability in the software.

3. To fix the issue identified by the "iterators3" pattern, developers should ensure that each iterator is only used with the container it was intended for. If multiple containers need to be iterated over, separate iterators should be used for each container to prevent cross-contamination of data and potential bugs. Review the code to identify where the iterators are being incorrectly shared among different containers and refactor the code to use distinct iterators for each container. By following this practice, the risk of introducing errors due to using the same iterator across different containers can be mitigated, improving the code's reliability and maintainability.

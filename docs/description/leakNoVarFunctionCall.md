# Allocation with funcName, funcName doesn't release it.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `leakNoVarFunctionCall` Cppcheck pattern is designed to detect instances where a function call involving memory allocation is made, but the allocated memory is not properly released. In the provided code snippet, the error occurs in the `functionCallLeak` function, where a potential memory leak is identified due to the lack of memory deallocation after a function call.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Proper memory management is crucial for code quality and security. Memory leaks can lead to inefficiencies in the program by consuming system resources unnecessarily. In the context of security, memory leaks can also introduce vulnerabilities such as denial-of-service attacks or information disclosure if sensitive data remains in memory after it should have been freed. Detecting and fixing memory leaks ensures that the program runs efficiently and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address the `leakNoVarFunctionCall` issue flagged by Cppcheck, you need to ensure that memory allocated during a function call is properly released to prevent memory leaks. In the provided code, you should add appropriate deallocation logic after the memory allocation operation. This typically involves calling the corresponding deallocation or release function to free the allocated memory. In the `functionCallLeak` function, make sure to include the necessary memory deallocation step after the allocation operation to resolve the memory leak. Additionally, review other parts of the codebase to ensure that all memory allocations are properly managed and deallocated as needed to maintain code quality and security.

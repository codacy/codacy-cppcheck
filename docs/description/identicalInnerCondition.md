# Identical inner 'if' condition is always true.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `identicalInnerCondition` pattern in Cppcheck looks for instances where the same condition is being checked twice within the same context. In the given code snippet, it specifically identifies when the inner condition (represented by `s2` in this case) is identical to another inner condition, which can lead to redundant or unnecessary checks.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Identical inner conditions being always true or false can indicate a logic flaw in the code. Redundant checks not only decrease code readability but can also introduce performance overheads. In terms of security, such redundancy might hide the actual intent of the code and make it harder to identify potential vulnerabilities or bugs.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address the `identicalInnerCondition` warning reported by Cppcheck, you should review the logic surrounding the repeated conditions and refactor the code to eliminate the redundancy. This can involve consolidating the conditions, reusing variables, or restructuring the control flow to ensure that each condition is necessary and contributes meaningfully to the program logic. By removing redundant checks, you can improve code clarity, performance, and potentially uncover hidden issues that might have been obscured by unnecessary complexity.

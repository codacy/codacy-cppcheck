# Dangerous comparison using operator< on iterator.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, with Error ID "stlBoundaries", looks for dangerous comparisons using the operator '<' on iterators in C++ code.

2. It matters for code quality and security because using the '<' operator to compare iterators in C++ can lead to undefined behavior if the iterators do not belong to the same container or range. This can result in runtime errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior in the program. In C++, iterators are not required to be implemented as simple pointers, so comparing them using '<' does not guarantee a meaningful result.

3. To fix this issue, you should replace the usage of the '<' operator with the '!=' operator when comparing iterators in C++ code. The '!=' operator is the correct way to compare iterators for equality or inequality. By using '!=', you ensure that the comparison is valid and safe across different containers or ranges. Here's an example of how to fix the code snippet provided:
   
```cpp
Token* const end = var->scope()->bodyEnd;
for (const Token *tok = var->nameToken(); tok != end; tok = tok->next()) {
    if (Token::Match(tok, "!!* %varid% <", var->declarationId())) {
        stlBoundariesError(tok);
    } else if (Token::Match(tok, "> %varid% !!.", var->declarationId())) {
        stlBoundariesError(tok);
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, change the comparison `tok != end` to `tok != end` to fix the dangerous comparison using the '<' operator on iterators. This correction ensures safer and more reliable iterator comparisons, improving the overall quality and security of the code.

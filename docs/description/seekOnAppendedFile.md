# Repositioning operation performed on a file opened in append mode has no effect.

1. This Cppcheck pattern, identified by the error ID "seekOnAppendedFile", looks for instances where a repositioning operation (such as seeking) is performed on a file that has been opened in append mode. When a file is opened in append mode, seeking has no effect because all writes are automatically positioned at the end of the file.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because performing unnecessary or ineffective operations can lead to confusion, inefficiencies, or unexpected behavior in the code. In the case of seeking on a file opened in append mode, it indicates a potential misunderstanding of file handling mechanisms, which could result in wasted resources or incorrect file manipulation.

3. To fix the issue flagged by this Cppcheck warning, you should review the code where the seeking operation is being performed on a file opened in append mode. Consider whether the seeking operation is necessary or if it can be omitted. If the seeking operation is indeed required, you may need to reconsider the file opening mode to ensure that seeking has the intended effect. Alternatively, you can refactor the code to handle file positioning in a way that aligns with the append mode of the file, such as always writing data at the end of the file without seeking explicitly.

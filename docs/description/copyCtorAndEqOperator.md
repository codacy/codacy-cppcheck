# The class 'class' has 'operator=' but lack of 'copy constructor'.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `copyCtorAndEqOperator` check in Cppcheck is designed to identify situations where a class or struct in C++ has either a copy constructor or an assignment operator overloaded, but lacks the other. It detects this inconsistency in the implementation of these two essential functions.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Ensuring that a class or struct in C++ has both a copy constructor and an assignment operator is crucial for maintaining code quality and avoiding potential issues related to object copying and assignment. Failing to provide both functions can lead to unexpected behavior, memory leaks, or even security vulnerabilities in the codebase. Therefore, this check helps in enforcing a consistent and robust implementation of these fundamental operations.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address the `copyCtorAndEqOperator` warning reported by Cppcheck, you should review the class or struct in question and ensure that both the copy constructor and the assignment operator are properly defined. If either of these functions is missing, you should implement it according to the requirements of your codebase. By providing both the copy constructor and the assignment operator, you can enhance the reliability and maintainability of your C++ code while addressing the potential issues highlighted by this Cppcheck pattern.

# Race condition: non-interlocked access after InterlockedDecrement(). Use InterlockedDecrement() return value instead.

1. This Cppcheck error, identified by the error ID "raceAfterInterlockedDecrement", detects a race condition in the code where a non-interlocked access operation is performed after an InterlockedDecrement() function call. The error message suggests that the return value of the InterlockedDecrement() function should be used instead of directly accessing the variable.

2. Addressing this issue is crucial for code quality and security. Race conditions occur when multiple threads access and manipulate shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential data corruption. In this case, using InterlockedDecrement() ensures that the decrement operation is atomic and avoids race conditions by providing a synchronized way to access and modify shared variables.

3. To fix the issue raised by this Cppcheck error, you should modify the code to use the return value of the InterlockedDecrement() function instead of directly accessing the variable. By using the return value, you ensure that the decrement operation is performed atomically and thread-safe. This modification helps prevent race conditions and ensures the integrity of shared data in a multi-threaded environment.

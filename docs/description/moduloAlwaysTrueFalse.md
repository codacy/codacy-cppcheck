# Comparison of modulo result is predetermined, because it is always less than 1.

1. This Cppcheck check with the error ID "moduloAlwaysTrueFalse" looks for instances in the code where a comparison of the modulo operation result is being made, but the comparison is predetermined to always evaluate to a specific outcome. Specifically, it checks if the comparison of the modulo result is always less than a certain value based on the code logic.

2. This check is important for code quality and potentially for security reasons. When a comparison of the modulo result is predetermined to always evaluate to a specific outcome, it indicates a potential issue with the logic in the code. Such situations can lead to unnecessary or incorrect comparisons, which can introduce bugs, reduce code clarity, and impact the maintainability of the code. In certain contexts, such issues can also introduce vulnerabilities or lead to unexpected behavior in the software.

3. To fix the issue highlighted by this Cppcheck check, you need to review the logic that involves the modulo operation and the subsequent comparison. Ensure that the modulo operation and the comparison are correctly implemented and are based on the actual requirements of the code. If the comparison is truly predetermined and always results in the same outcome, consider revising the logic to remove the unnecessary comparison or to adjust it based on the actual conditions that need to be evaluated. By addressing the issue identified by this Cppcheck warning, you can enhance the code quality, improve its clarity, and potentially eliminate any hidden bugs or vulnerabilities related to the incorrect comparison of modulo results.

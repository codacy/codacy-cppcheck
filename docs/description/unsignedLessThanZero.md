# Checking if unsigned expression 'varname' is less than zero.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck pattern "Unsigned less than zero" looks for instances in the code where an unsigned expression is being checked if it is less than zero. The check is performed by analyzing the comparison operations on unsigned values to ensure that they are not being compared to negative values.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Comparing an unsigned variable against a negative value is illogical and can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the code. In C++, unsigned integers cannot represent negative values, so any comparison against a negative value is always false. This can indicate a mistake in the code logic or a misunderstanding of the underlying data types, which can introduce vulnerabilities or lead to incorrect program behavior.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck pattern, you should review the comparison operations involving unsigned variables to ensure that they are not mistakenly being compared to negative values. If the intention is to check for a specific condition, make sure to use comparisons that are valid for unsigned data types. Common fixes include:
   - Ensure that comparisons involving unsigned variables are done against other unsigned values or constants that are within the valid range for unsigned types.
   - If the comparison is meant to check for a specific condition, refactor the logic to use appropriate comparisons or conditions that make sense for unsigned data types.
   - Consider revisiting the design of the code to ensure that unsigned variables are used correctly and consistently throughout the program.
  
By addressing these issues, you can improve the correctness and reliability of your code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or vulnerabilities related to incorrect comparisons involving unsigned values.

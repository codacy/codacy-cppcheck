# Boolean expression 'expression' is used in bitwise operation. Did you mean '&&'?

1. This Cppcheck pattern 'bitwiseOnBoolean' looks for instances where a boolean expression is used in a bitwise operation. In the provided code snippet, it is checking for such occurrences and reporting them as a style issue.

2. It matters for code quality and potentially security because using boolean expressions in bitwise operations can lead to unintended behavior or logical errors in the program. Bitwise operations are meant to manipulate individual bits in integer types, whereas boolean expressions should be used for logical comparisons. Mixing them up can result in code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and debug.

3. To fix the issue identified by the 'bitwiseOnBoolean' pattern, you should review the code where the error is reported and ensure that boolean expressions are not used in bitwise operations. If a bitwise operation is intended, make sure to use integer types instead of boolean operands. If the intended operation is a logical comparison, correct the code to use proper boolean operators like '&&' (logical AND) or '||' (logical OR) instead of bitwise operators like '&' (bitwise AND) or '|' (bitwise OR). By making these adjustments, you can improve the clarity, correctness, and maintainability of the code.

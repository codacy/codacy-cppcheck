# Null pointer dereference

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `nullPointer` check in Cppcheck is looking for instances where a null pointer is being dereferenced in the code. This means that the code is attempting to access a memory location through a pointer that has not been assigned a valid memory address, causing a runtime error.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Null pointer dereference can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities in a program. When a null pointer is dereferenced, it can result in memory access violations, leading to program instability or even potential exploitation by attackers. Identifying and fixing null pointer dereference issues is crucial for ensuring the reliability and security of the code.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the null pointer dereference issue detected by Cppcheck, you need to ensure that the pointer being dereferenced is not null before accessing its value. This can be done by adding proper null checks before dereferencing the pointer. In the provided code snippet, you can see that the checks are already in place for both `tok` and `value` pointers. If the pointers can legitimately be null in certain cases, make sure to handle those scenarios appropriately to prevent null pointer dereference errors.

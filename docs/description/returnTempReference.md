# Reference to temporary returned.

1. The "returnStdMoveLocal" Cppcheck pattern looks for instances where `std::move` is used to return an object by-value from a function. This usage can potentially affect copy elision optimization.

2. This check is important for code performance optimization. Using `std::move` unnecessarily in this context can prevent copy elision, a compiler optimization technique where unnecessary copies of objects are avoided. By inhibiting copy elision, unnecessary overhead in terms of object copying and destruction can be introduced, impacting both the performance and efficiency of the code.

3. To fix the issue highlighted by this Cppcheck pattern, you should review the usage of `std::move` for returning objects by-value from functions. If the move is not necessary and is hindering copy elision optimization, consider removing the `std::move` operation from the return statement. By allowing the compiler to perform copy elision optimizations naturally, the code can be more efficient and maintain better performance.

# Invalid func_name() argument nr 1. A nul-terminated string is required.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the error ID "invalidFunctionArgStr", checks for cases where a function is called with an invalid argument type. Specifically, it looks for instances where a function that expects a null-terminated string as an argument is called with a non-string argument.

2. Ensuring that functions are called with the correct argument types is crucial for code quality and security. Passing incorrect argument types can lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. By enforcing the correct argument types, developers can prevent runtime errors and potential security risks in their code.

3. To fix the issue identified by the "invalidFunctionArgStr" error, you need to review the function calls and ensure that functions expecting null-terminated strings are only called with appropriate string arguments. If you encounter a case where a non-string argument is being passed to such a function, you should modify the code to provide the correct string argument. Additionally, consider adding type checks or validation logic to prevent such errors from occurring in the future.

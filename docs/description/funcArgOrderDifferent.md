# Function 'function' argument order different: declaration '' definition ''

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the error ID `funcArgOrderDifferent`, checks for functions where the order of arguments in the function declaration and definition is different.

2. It matters for code quality and security because having inconsistent argument orders between the function declaration and definition can lead to potential bugs and unexpected behavior in the program. This can make the code harder to maintain and debug, as developers may not realize that the arguments are in a different order, leading to incorrect function calls and results. In some cases, it can also introduce security vulnerabilities if the function arguments are not handled correctly due to the mismatch in order.

3. To fix this issue, you should carefully review and ensure that the order of arguments in the function declaration matches the order of arguments in the function definition. Make sure that the arguments are in the same order and have the same types in both places. Refactor the code if necessary to align the argument order in both the declaration and definition. By maintaining consistency in the argument order, you can improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs or security vulnerabilities.

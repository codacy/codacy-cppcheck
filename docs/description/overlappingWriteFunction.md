# Overlapping read/write in () is undefined behavior

1. The `overlappingWriteFunction` Cppcheck pattern looks for situations in the code where there is an overlapping read and write operation within a function. This means that the function is both reading and writing to the same memory location simultaneously, which can lead to undefined behavior.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because overlapping read and write operations can result in unpredictable behavior, memory corruption, and hard-to-find bugs. Such issues can lead to crashes, data corruption, security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, and other serious consequences. By identifying and fixing these overlapping read/write scenarios, the code becomes more reliable, maintainable, and secure.

3. To fix the issue highlighted by the `overlappingWriteFunction` Cppcheck pattern, you need to carefully review the function where the error occurs and ensure that there are no simultaneous read and write operations on the same memory location. To resolve this, you may need to refactor the code to separate read and write operations or use synchronization mechanisms like locks or mutexes to ensure that data is accessed safely. By restructuring the code to avoid overlapping read and write operations, you can eliminate the risk of undefined behavior and potential issues in your software.

# Division by zero.

### Cppcheck Pattern: **zerodivcond**

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck pattern, identified by the error ID `zerodivcond`, examines code for potential division by zero conditions in conditional statements. It warns when a division by zero may occur based on the condition evaluated in the code.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Detecting potential division by zero situations is crucial for code quality and security. Division by zero can lead to unexpected runtime behavior like crashes, undefined behavior, or incorrect results. Such errors are often hard to trace and can introduce vulnerabilities in the software, making it prone to exploitation by attackers.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address the `zerodivcond` warning, ensure that the conditional statements are evaluated properly to avoid division by zero scenarios. Here are some steps to fix the issue:
   - Validate the input values to ensure that the denominator in any division operation is not zero.
   - Implement appropriate checks or guards in the code to handle potential division by zero cases gracefully, such as using conditional statements or error handling mechanisms.
   - Refactor the code to avoid scenarios where division by zero can occur, potentially by restructuring the logic or adding explicit checks before performing division operations.

By addressing the `zerodivcond` warning effectively, you can enhance the reliability, stability, and security of your C++ codebase.

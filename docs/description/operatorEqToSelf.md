# 'operator=' should check for assignment to self to avoid problems with dynamic memory.

### 1. What this check looks for:
The `operatorEqToSelf` check in Cppcheck looks for instances where the assignment operator (`operator=`) in a class does not properly check for self-assignment. Self-assignment occurs when an object is assigned to itself, which can lead to problems with dynamic memory management.

### 2. Why it matters for code quality/security:
Failure to properly handle self-assignment in the assignment operator can result in issues with dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. If an object is assigned to itself without proper checks, it can lead to memory leaks, double deletion of memory, or other memory-related bugs. These issues can impact the stability, performance, and security of the code.

### 3. How to fix the issue:
To fix the `operatorEqToSelf` issue, the assignment operator (`operator=`) in the class should include a self-assignment check before performing any operations. This check ensures that the object is not assigned to itself, thereby preventing potential memory-related problems. Here is an example of how to add a self-assignment check in the assignment operator:

```cpp
ClassName& ClassName::operator=(const ClassName& other) {
    if (this != &other) { // Check for self-assignment
        // Perform the assignment
        // Copy data members from 'other' to 'this'
    }
    return *this;
}
```

By including this self-assignment check in the assignment operator, you can improve the robustness and reliability of your code, particularly in scenarios involving dynamic memory management.

# 'operator=' should either return reference to 'this' instance or be declared private and left unimplemented.

1. This Cppcheck pattern, `operatorEqShouldBeLeftUnimplemented`, looks for instances where the `operator=` overload in a C++ class does not follow best practices. Specifically, it checks if the `operator=` overload either does not return a reference to `this` instance or is not declared as private and left unimplemented.

2. Ensuring that the `operator=` overload either returns a reference to `this` or is left unimplemented as private is important for code quality and security. Returning a reference to `this` allows for chaining assignments and follows the expected behavior of assignment operators in C++. On the other hand, leaving the `operator=` unimplemented as private prevents unintended usage or potential issues arising from improper assignment behavior.

3. To fix the issue flagged by this Cppcheck pattern, you should review the `operator=` overload in the class in question. If the `operator=` overload is intended to modify the current instance and should support chaining assignments, ensure that it returns a reference to `this` (e.g., `ClassName& operator=(const ClassName& rhs)`). If the `operator=` overload is not meant to be used or should not be implemented, declare it as private and do not provide an implementation, effectively preventing its usage. By following these best practices, you can improve the maintainability and robustness of your C++ codebase.

# printf format string requires 3 parameters but only 2 are given.

### 1. What this check looks for:
This Cppcheck pattern, `wrongPrintfScanfParameterPositionError`, is designed to detect issues related to incorrect positions of parameters in `printf` and `scanf` functions. Specifically, it checks for instances where the parameter positions are referenced starting from 0 instead of 1 in `printf` or `scanf` format strings.

### 2. Why it matters for code quality/security:
Correct parameter indexing in `printf` and `scanf` functions is crucial for code quality and security. Incorrect parameter positions can lead to unexpected behavior, such as printing or scanning the wrong values, which may result in runtime errors or security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities. By enforcing the correct indexing, this check helps prevent such issues from occurring in the codebase.

### 3. How to fix the issue:
To resolve this issue identified by the `wrongPrintfScanfParameterPositionError` check, you should ensure that the parameter positions in `printf` and `scanf` format strings start from 1, not 0. Review the affected code where the error is reported and adjust the parameter references to start from 1 instead of 0. By correcting the parameter positions, you can align the code with the expected behavior of these functions and mitigate potential runtime errors or security risks associated with incorrect indexing.

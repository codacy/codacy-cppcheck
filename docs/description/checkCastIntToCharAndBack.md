# Storing func_name() return value in char variable and then comparing with EOF.

1. This Cppcheck pattern "checkCastIntToCharAndBack" looks for instances where an integer value is cast to a char type, and then later compared with the EOF (End of File) constant. This pattern aims to identify potential issues related to loss of precision and unexpected behavior when dealing with char variables storing integer values.

2. It matters for code quality and security because casting an integer to a char can lead to loss of data due to the smaller range of values that can be represented by a char compared to an integer. When comparing this char variable with EOF, which is typically defined as -1, unexpected results can occur due to the truncation of values and the implicit conversion of types. This can introduce bugs and vulnerabilities in the code, impacting its reliability and security.

3. To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck pattern, you should avoid casting integer values to char when storing values that might be compared with EOF. Instead, use appropriate data types that can represent the full range of values without loss of precision. If comparison with EOF is necessary, ensure that the data type used can correctly represent the EOF constant without truncation or unexpected behavior. Review the code logic to handle integer values and comparisons appropriately to prevent potential issues related to type conversions and data loss.

# Suspicious use of ; at the end of '' statement.

1. The "macroWithSemicolon" check in Cppcheck looks for instances where a macro definition or usage is followed by a semicolon in C or C++ code. This error pattern is identified by the presence of a semicolon directly after a macro, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.

2. Ensuring that macros are correctly defined and used without unnecessary semicolons is important for maintaining code quality and security. Incorrect macro usage can introduce subtle bugs, make the code harder to understand, and potentially create vulnerabilities in the software. By flagging instances of macros followed by semicolons, Cppcheck helps developers identify and rectify these issues before they cause problems in the codebase.

3. To fix the "macroWithSemicolon" issue flagged by Cppcheck, developers should review the macro definitions and usages in the code to ensure that there are no unintended semicolons present. Macros should not be followed by semicolons unless explicitly intended. Removing any extraneous semicolons after macros and verifying the correct usage of macros can resolve this error pattern and improve the overall quality and reliability of the code.

# Using object that is a temporary.

1. The `danglingTemporaryLifetime` Cppcheck pattern looks for situations where a temporary object is created and then used beyond its intended lifetime. This can happen when a temporary object is created within a function and then a reference or pointer to it is stored for later use outside the function.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because using a temporary object after its lifetime has ended can lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. It can be difficult to predict the behavior of such code and can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to diagnose and fix.

3. To fix the issue identified by the `danglingTemporaryLifetime` pattern, you should ensure that any temporary objects are used within the scope where they are created and not stored for later use outside that scope. One common solution is to avoid storing references or pointers to temporary objects and instead use them directly where needed. Additionally, make sure to understand the lifetime of objects and variables in your code and avoid using them after they have been destroyed. Proper memory management practices, such as using smart pointers or managing object lifetimes carefully, can also help prevent dangling temporary lifetime issues.

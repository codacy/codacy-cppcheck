# Calling 'erase' while iterating the container is invalid.

1. **What this check looks for:**
The `invalidContainerLoop` check in Cppcheck looks for instances in the code where a container is being modified (e.g., elements added or removed) while it is being iterated over in a loop. This situation can lead to undefined behavior and potential bugs in the program.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
Modifying a container while iterating over it can result in unexpected behavior such as skipping elements, accessing invalid memory, or causing the program to crash. These issues can introduce bugs into the software, making it harder to maintain, debug, and potentially creating security vulnerabilities. By detecting and preventing such scenarios, the code quality and security of the software can be improved.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
To fix the `invalidContainerLoop` issue, you should refactor the code to ensure that no modifications are made to the container while it is being iterated over. One common approach is to use a separate temporary container to store the elements that need to be modified, and then apply the modifications after the iteration has completed. Alternatively, you can use iterators that are safe for modifications, such as `std::list::insert` or `std::list::erase`, or consider using algorithms like `std::remove_if` to perform modifications on containers without directly altering them during iteration. By restructuring the code to separate iteration and modification logic, you can avoid the pitfalls associated with modifying containers during iteration, improving the reliability and maintainability of the code.

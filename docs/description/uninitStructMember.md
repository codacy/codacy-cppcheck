# Uninitialized struct member: a.b

1. The "uninitStructMember" Cppcheck pattern looks for uninitialized struct members within C++ code. Specifically, it flags instances where a struct member is being used without being properly initialized beforehand.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because using uninitialized struct members can lead to undefined behavior, bugs, or vulnerabilities in the software. Accessing uninitialized memory can result in crashes, incorrect behavior, or even security vulnerabilities like information leaks or code execution exploits.

3. To fix the issue flagged by the "uninitStructMember" pattern, ensure that all struct members are properly initialized before being accessed or used. This can be done by initializing struct members either at the point of declaration or in the constructor of the struct. By ensuring that all struct members have valid initial values, you can prevent potential issues related to uninitialized memory access.

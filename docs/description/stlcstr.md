# Dangerous usage of c_str(). The value returned by c_str() is invalid after this call.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation named "stlcstrthrow" looks for dangerous usage of `c_str()` in C++ code. Specifically, it warns about situations where the value returned by `c_str()` is used in a way that could lead to issues after an exception is thrown.

2. It matters for code quality and security because using the value returned by `c_str()` after throwing an exception can lead to accessing invalid memory. When an exception is thrown, the `std::string` object from which `c_str()` was called may be destroyed, making the pointer returned by `c_str()` invalid. Accessing invalid memory can result in crashes, undefined behavior, or security vulnerabilities in the code.

3. To fix this issue, you should ensure that the value returned by `c_str()` is not used beyond the point where an exception might be thrown. One way to address this is by copying the content of the `std::string` before throwing an exception, so that the copied content remains valid. Another approach is to use `std::string` methods or other mechanisms to handle string data instead of relying on the pointer returned by `c_str()`. By doing so, you can prevent potential issues related to using invalidated pointers after exceptions occur in your C++ code.

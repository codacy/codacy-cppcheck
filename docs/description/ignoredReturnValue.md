# Return value of function malloc() is not used.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID "ignoredReturnErrorCode", checks for instances where an error code returned by a function is not properly handled or stored.

2. It is important for code quality and security to handle error codes returned by functions properly. Ignoring error codes can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect program flow, and potential vulnerabilities. If an error code is not checked or handled, it may indicate a potential issue in the code that could result in bugs or security vulnerabilities.

3. To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck error, you should review the code where the error code is returned and ensure that it is properly checked and handled. This may involve storing the error code in a variable, checking it against specific error values, and taking appropriate actions based on the error code received. By addressing this issue, you can improve the robustness and reliability of the code, leading to better code quality and enhanced security.

# Write operation on a file that was opened only for reading.

### Cppcheck Pattern: readWriteOnlyFile

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `readWriteOnlyFile` pattern in Cppcheck looks for instances in the code where a read operation is performed on a file that was opened only for writing. This error occurs when there is an attempt to read data from a file that was intended for writing operations only.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Performing a read operation on a file opened in write-only mode can lead to undefined behavior and potential runtime errors. This issue can result in reading incorrect data, corrupting the file, or causing unexpected program behavior. Addressing this error is crucial for maintaining code quality, preventing bugs, and ensuring the security and stability of the software.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the `readWriteOnlyFile` issue identified by Cppcheck, you need to review the file handling operations in the code and ensure that files are opened with the appropriate permissions (read-only or write-only) based on the intended operations. If a file needs to be both read from and written to, it should be opened in a mode that allows for both read and write operations. Modify the file opening mode to allow reading if reading operations are necessary in the code. Additionally, ensure proper error handling mechanisms are in place to handle any file operation failures effectively.

By addressing and resolving the `readWriteOnlyFile` issue, you can enhance the reliability, maintainability, and security of the codebase, ultimately improving the overall quality of the software application.

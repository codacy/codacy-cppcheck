# Non-boolean value returned from function returning bool

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the error ID `returnNonBoolInBooleanFunction`, checks for instances where a non-boolean value is returned from a function that is declared to return a boolean type.

2. This check is important for code quality because it helps in enforcing strict type checking and adherence to function return type declarations. When a function is expected to return a boolean value (true or false), returning a non-boolean value can lead to unexpected behavior or logical errors in the code. This can introduce bugs, reduce code readability, and make the code harder to maintain. In terms of security, such inconsistencies can potentially lead to vulnerabilities in the software.

3. To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck pattern, you should review the function that is flagged by the error. Ensure that the function's return type is correctly declared as `bool`. If the function logic requires a boolean return value, make sure that all return statements within the function actually return boolean values (true or false). If a non-boolean value needs to be returned, consider changing the return type of the function to a more appropriate type or refactoring the logic to return a boolean value as intended. By addressing this issue, you can improve the code's correctness, maintainability, and adherence to type safety principles.

# Parameter 'x' can be declared with const

1. This Cppcheck error implementation with the Error ID `constVariable` looks for variables that can be declared with the `const` qualifier. In the provided source context, the error is triggered when a variable 'x' is detected as not being declared as `const`.

2. This check matters for code quality and security because using the `const` qualifier for variables can help prevent accidental modification of the variable's value, leading to more predictable and maintainable code. By marking variables as `const`, you communicate the intent that the variable's value should not change after initialization, which can make the code easier to read and understand. Additionally, using `const` can also help catch unintended side effects or bugs caused by modifying variables that were not intended to be changed.

3. To fix the issue highlighted by this Cppcheck error, you should declare the variable 'x' with the `const` qualifier where applicable. For example, if the variable 'x' is not intended to be modified after initialization, you can declare it as const like this:
   ```cpp
   const Variable* var = someValue;
   ```
   By adding `const` before the variable type, you ensure that the variable is read-only and cannot be modified inadvertently. This practice promotes code safety, clarity, and maintainability.

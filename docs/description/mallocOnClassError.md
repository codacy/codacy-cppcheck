# Memory for class instance allocated with malloc(), but class contains a std::string.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the error ID "mallocOnClassError", looks for instances where memory allocation functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc` are used to allocate memory for a class instance that has constructors defined. Specifically, it checks for situations where memory is allocated using a function like `malloc` but the class has constructors that should be responsible for initializing the class members.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Using memory allocation functions directly on a class instance that has constructors can lead to serious issues related to uninitialized data members. When memory is allocated using `malloc` or similar functions, constructors are not called, resulting in uninitialized data members. Uninitialized data can cause undefined behavior, security vulnerabilities, and hard-to-debug issues in the code. By flagging such instances, this check helps prevent potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix this issue, the code should be refactored to use proper object creation and initialization mechanisms provided by C++. Instead of using `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc` to allocate memory for a class instance, the code should use `new` operator to create objects. The `new` operator ensures that the constructor of the class is called, initializing all class members properly. By using `new`, the risk of uninitialized data and associated issues is mitigated. Additionally, it is important to ensure that proper memory management practices are followed, such as using `delete` to free the memory allocated using `new` to avoid memory leaks.

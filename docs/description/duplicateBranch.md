# Found duplicate branches for 'if' and 'else'.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The Cppcheck error `duplicateBranch` is triggered when the code contains duplicate branches in an if-else construct. In the provided source context, the function `duplicateBranchError` is invoked with two tokens `tok1` and `tok2`, which are part of the same if-else block. This indicates that the same code logic is present in both the if and else branches, leading to duplicate branches.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Detecting duplicate branches is essential for maintaining code quality and ensuring code correctness. Having identical code in both branches of an if-else statement can indicate a logical error, redundancy, or a copy-paste mistake. Such duplication not only hinders code readability but also increases the risk of introducing bugs during maintenance or modifications. Resolving duplicate branches is crucial for improving code maintainability and reducing the likelihood of logic errors.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address the `duplicateBranch` error, carefully review the if-else blocks in the code to identify and eliminate any duplicate logic. Consider the following steps to resolve the issue:
   - Analyze the code within the if and else blocks to determine if the duplication is intentional or accidental.
   - Refactor the code to remove redundant or repeated logic that exists in both branches.
   - Consider creating a separate function or moving the common code outside the if-else construct to promote code reusability and maintainability.
   - Ensure that the if and else branches each serve a distinct purpose and contain unique logic to correctly handle different conditions.

By resolving the duplicate branches identified by Cppcheck, developers can enhance code clarity, reduce potential bugs, and improve the overall quality and reliability of the software.

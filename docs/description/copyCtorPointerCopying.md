# Value of pointer 'var', which points to allocated memory, is copied in copy constructor instead of allocating new memory.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation is for the "copyCtorPointerCopying" pattern. It checks for instances where a copy constructor in C++ is copying the value of a pointer that points to allocated memory instead of allocating new memory. This can lead to issues related to shallow copying and potential memory leaks.

2. This check is important for code quality and security because copying pointers to allocated memory without actually allocating new memory can result in multiple pointers pointing to the same memory location. This can lead to unintended side effects when one pointer modifies the memory, affecting the data accessed through other pointers. It can also cause memory leaks if the memory is not properly managed and deallocated.

3. To fix the issue identified by this check, you should ensure that copy constructors in your code allocate new memory for the copied pointers instead of simply copying the pointer values. This can be achieved by implementing deep copy semantics in the copy constructor, where a new memory block is allocated and the contents of the original memory block are copied to the new block. By doing so, each object will have its own separate memory allocation, avoiding issues related to shallow copying and multiple pointers pointing to the same memory location.

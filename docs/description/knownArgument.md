# Argument 'x-x' to function 'func' is always 0. It does not matter what value 'x' has.

1. The "knownArgument" Cppcheck pattern looks for cases where an argument passed to a function is known to always evaluate to 0, regardless of the value of the variable being passed. In the provided code snippet, the error is triggered when the function "knownArgumentError" is called with specific arguments.

2. It matters for code quality and potentially security because passing arguments that are known to have a fixed value can lead to unnecessary computations or incorrect behavior in the program. In some cases, it can indicate a programming mistake or an inefficient use of resources. Addressing such issues can help improve the clarity and efficiency of the codebase.

3. To fix the issue, you need to review the implementation of the function "knownArgumentError" and identify why the argument 'x-x' is always 0. Depending on the context and logic of the program, you may need to adjust the way the argument is calculated or passed to the function. It is important to ensure that the function receives meaningful and relevant arguments to avoid unnecessary computations or unintended consequences in the code.

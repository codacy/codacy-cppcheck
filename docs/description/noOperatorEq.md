# Class 'class' does not have a operator= which is recommended since it has dynamic memory/resource allocation(s).

1. The "noOperatorEq" Cppcheck pattern looks for occurrences where a class does not have an assignment operator (operator=) defined. This typically means that the class has not implemented a custom assignment operator, relying on the default behavior provided by the compiler.

2. This check matters for code quality and security because not defining a custom assignment operator can lead to unintended behavior and potential issues such as shallow copying, memory leaks, or incorrect behavior when objects are copied. By explicitly defining and implementing an assignment operator, developers can ensure proper handling of member variables and resources, leading to more robust and predictable code.

3. To fix the issue identified by the "noOperatorEq" pattern, you should define a custom assignment operator for the class that properly handles copying of member variables and resources. This involves overloading the assignment operator (=) in the class definition, implementing deep copying if necessary, and ensuring that any dynamically allocated memory or resources are properly managed during assignment operations. By explicitly defining the assignment operator, you can control how objects are copied and avoid potential issues related to shallow copying or resource leaks.

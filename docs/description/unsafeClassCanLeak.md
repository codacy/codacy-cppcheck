# Class 'class' is unsafe, 'class::varname' can leak by wrong usage.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation with the ID "unsafeClassCanLeak" looks for instances where a class is identified as unsafe due to the potential of a member variable to leak memory or resources if not properly managed. It specifically checks if a member variable is allocated but not deallocated within the class, leading to a possible memory leak.

2. This check is essential for code quality and security as memory leaks can degrade the performance of the application over time by consuming system resources unnecessarily. Memory leaks can also lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, and vulnerabilities in the software, making it crucial to address such issues proactively.

3. To fix the issue identified by this check, ensure that proper memory/resource management practices are followed within the class. Specifically, allocate memory/resources for member variables only when necessary and make sure to deallocate them appropriately, such as in the class destructor or in a cleanup function. By implementing proper memory management techniques like smart pointers or RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) in C++, you can prevent memory leaks and enhance the overall robustness and reliability of the codebase.

# Using reference 'arg1' as parameter for va_start() results in undefined behaviour.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck error, with the Error ID `va_start_referencePassed`, is triggered when a reference is used as a parameter for the `va_start()` function in C++. The `va_start()` function is used to initialize a `va_list` object for accessing the variable arguments passed to a variadic function.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Using a reference as a parameter for `va_start()` results in undefined behavior according to the C++ standard. This can lead to unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities if the program relies on the correct behavior of `va_start()` and `va_arg()` functions.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To resolve this issue and ensure code quality and security:
   - Ensure that only variables (not references) are passed as parameters to the `va_start()` function.
   - If the intention is to pass a reference, reconsider the design and usage of variadic functions to avoid relying on undefined behavior.
   - Review the code where `va_start()` is being used and make sure that correct variable types are passed as parameters.
   - Consider refactoring the code to use safer alternatives to variadic functions if possible, such as using variadic templates in modern C++. 

By addressing the `va_start_referencePassed` error, you can improve the reliability and maintainability of your codebase, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

# Function 'function' argument 2 names different: declaration 'A' definition 'B'.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   Cppcheck's `funcArgNamesDifferent` error pattern looks for situations where the names of function arguments in a function declaration do not match the names of the corresponding arguments in the function definition.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Ensuring consistency between the names of function arguments in declarations and definitions is important for code maintainability, readability, and understanding. Mismatched argument names can lead to confusion for developers working on the codebase, potentially introducing bugs or making it harder to diagnose issues. In terms of security, inconsistent argument names could indicate a lack of clarity in the code, making it more susceptible to vulnerabilities.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To resolve the `funcArgNamesDifferent` error, you need to carefully review the function declarations and definitions in your codebase and ensure that the names of function arguments match exactly between them. Make sure that the names are spelled correctly and consistently in both places. If there are discrepancies, update either the declaration or the definition to align the argument names. By maintaining consistency in function argument names, you can improve the code's readability, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of introducing errors.

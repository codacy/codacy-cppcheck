# Comparison of identical string variables.

1. This Cppcheck pattern, named "stringCompare", looks for instances where identical string variables are being compared in the code. The comparison can be unnecessary and may indicate a logic bug or suboptimal coding practice.

2. It matters for code quality and security because comparing identical string variables serves no purpose and can lead to confusion for developers reviewing the code. It may also indicate a potential mistake or oversight in the code logic, which could introduce bugs or vulnerabilities into the software.

3. To fix the issue identified by this Cppcheck pattern, you should review the code where the comparison is being made and determine if the comparison is indeed necessary. If the comparison is redundant or serves no logical purpose, you should remove it to improve code clarity and potentially prevent future bugs or security vulnerabilities. It is important to ensure that string comparisons are meaningful and contribute to the intended functionality of the code.

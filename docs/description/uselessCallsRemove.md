# Return value of std::remove() ignored. Elements remain in container.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This check, identified by the error ID `uselessCallsRemove`, is looking for instances in the code where a return value of a standard C++ STL container method, such as `remove()`, is being ignored. This specific error is triggered when the return value of `std::$symbol()` is ignored, which results in elements remaining in the container even though the intention might have been to remove them.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Ignoring the return value of a method like `remove()` can lead to unintended behavior in the program. In the context of removing elements from a container, not using the return value can result in memory leaks, incorrect program logic, or unexpected state changes. This can introduce bugs, reduce the overall quality of the code, and potentially introduce security vulnerabilities if the ignored elements hold sensitive information or affect program correctness.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To address this issue and improve code quality and maintainability:
   - Review the code where the `uselessCallsRemove` error is reported and identify the specific container method being used where the return value is being ignored.
   - Determine if the intention was to remove elements from the container and ensure that the result is correctly handled.
   - Replace the ineffective call with appropriate handling, such as using the `erase()` method to actually remove elements from the container.
   - Update the code to use the return value of the container method as intended, ensuring that the program behaves as expected and the container is modified correctly.

By fixing this issue, you can enhance the reliability, efficiency, and security of your C++ codebase, avoiding potential pitfalls associated with ignoring important return values from container operations.

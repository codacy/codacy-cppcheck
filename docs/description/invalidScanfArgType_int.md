# %d in format string (no. 1) requires 'int *' but the argument type is Unknown.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID `invalidScanfArgType_int`, checks for instances where the `scanf` function is used with an incorrect argument type specified in the format string. Specifically, it focuses on cases where an integer type (`int`) is expected based on the format specifier used in the format string, but the actual argument provided is of a different type.

2. Ensuring that the correct argument type is used with the corresponding format specifier in functions like `scanf` is crucial for code quality and security. Using the wrong argument type can lead to undefined behavior, data corruption, memory access violations, and potentially security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities. By identifying and correcting such mismatches, this check helps prevent these issues and promotes safer and more reliable code.

3. To fix the issue reported by this check, you need to review the `scanf` statements in your code where the error was triggered. Make sure that the format specifiers used in the format string match the types of the variables being passed to `scanf`. For example, if `%d` is used in the format string, ensure that the corresponding argument is an `int` type. If the argument is of a different type (e.g., `float`, `double`, etc.), update the format specifier accordingly to match the type of the argument being passed. By ensuring consistency between the format specifiers and argument types, you can resolve the issue and improve the correctness and safety of your code.

# Calling 'sizeof' on 'sizeof'.

### 1. What this check looks for:
The `sizeofsizeof` check implemented in Cppcheck detects instances where the `sizeof` operator is being used on another `sizeof` operator within the code. It specifically looks for expressions like `sizeof(sizeof...)`, where `sizeof` is being called on another `sizeof`.

### 2. Why it matters for code quality/security:
Using `sizeof` on another `sizeof` expression is generally considered as suspicious code that could lead to confusion and potential bugs. It indicates a redundant or incorrect use of the `sizeof` operator, which may result in unintended behavior or incorrect calculations related to memory allocation or data types. Resolving such issues is important for maintaining code quality, readability, and ensuring the correctness and security of the software.

### 3. How to fix the issue:
To fix the issue identified by the `sizeofsizeof` check:
- Review the code where the `sizeof(sizeof...)` expression is used.
- Verify the intended logic and purpose behind using the nested `sizeof` operators.
- Determine if the nested `sizeof` is necessary, or if it can be simplified to just one `sizeof` operator.
- If the nested `sizeof` is redundant, remove the extra `sizeof` operator to make the code clearer and more maintainable.

By addressing and correcting instances where `sizeof` is called on another `sizeof`, developers can enhance the quality, reliability, and security of their C++ codebase.

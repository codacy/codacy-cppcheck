# Use const reference for 'varname' to avoid unnecessary data copying.

1. This Cppcheck pattern named `redundantCopyLocalConst` looks for instances in the code where a const variable is being copied unnecessarily instead of being used as a const reference.

2. This check is important for code performance optimization. Unnecessary copying of const variables can lead to inefficient memory usage and performance degradation in the program. Using const references instead of making unnecessary copies can help improve the overall performance of the code.

3. To fix this issue identified by the `redundantCopyLocalConst` check, developers should modify the code to use const references where applicable. By changing the variable declaration to a const reference, the code will avoid unnecessary data copying and potentially improve the performance of the program. Here's an example of how the code can be modified:

Before:
```cpp
void someFunction()
{
    const std::string var = "example";
    redundantCopyError(startTok, var);
}
```

After (fixed):
```cpp
void someFunction()
{
    const std::string& var = "example";
    redundantCopyError(startTok, var);
}
```

By making this simple adjustment in the code, unnecessary data copying can be avoided, leading to better code performance and efficiency.

# fflush() called on input stream 'stdin' may result in undefined behaviour on non-linux systems.

1. This Cppcheck error implementation, identified by the Error ID `fflushOnInputStream`, looks for instances where the `fflush()` function is called on an input stream, which can lead to undefined behavior. The code snippet provided shows a function `fflushOnInputStreamError` being called with a token and a variable name, reporting an error regarding the potential issue of calling `fflush()` on input streams.

2. Ensuring that `fflush()` is not called on input streams is important for code quality and security. Calling `fflush()` on input streams can result in undefined behavior, especially on non-Linux systems. This can lead to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. By avoiding such calls, the code becomes more robust and less prone to bugs and security issues.

3. To fix the issue highlighted by the `fflushOnInputStream` error, you should review the code where the `fflush()` function is being called. Ensure that `fflush()` is only used on output streams, not input streams. If `fflush()` is mistakenly used on an input stream, consider refactoring the code to remove the call or to handle input stream operations correctly without relying on `fflush()`. By making these adjustments, you can eliminate the risk of undefined behavior and improve the overall quality and security of the codebase.

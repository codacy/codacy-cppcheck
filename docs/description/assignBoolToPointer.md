# Boolean value assigned to pointer.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   The `assignBoolToPointer` check implemented in Cppcheck looks for instances in the code where a boolean value is assigned to a pointer variable. In the provided source code snippet, the check is performed within the `assignBoolToPointerError` function. The check iterates over tokens in the code and identifies assignments where the left operand is a pointer and the right operand is a boolean value.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Assigning a boolean value to a pointer variable can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially introduce bugs in the code. If a pointer is mistakenly assigned a boolean value, it can result in memory corruption, segmentation faults, or other undefined behavior. Such issues can be difficult to debug and may lead to security vulnerabilities in the software.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix the `assignBoolToPointer` issue identified by Cppcheck, you need to ensure that pointers are not assigned boolean values. Instead, you should assign valid memory addresses or nullptr to pointer variables. To resolve this specific error, you should review the code where the `assignBoolToPointerError` function is called and make sure that the assignment being flagged is corrected to assign a valid pointer value. Additionally, you may want to perform a thorough review of pointer assignments throughout the codebase to prevent similar issues from occurring elsewhere.

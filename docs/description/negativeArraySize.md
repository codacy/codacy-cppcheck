# Declaration of array '' with negative size is undefined behaviour

1. This Cppcheck error implementation is checking for negative array indexes in the code. It identifies situations where an array index is assigned a negative value, which can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the array.

2. This check is crucial for code quality and security because accessing memory with negative array indexes can result in buffer underrun or memory corruption issues. Negative array indexes can cause the program to read or write data to unintended memory locations, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potential security vulnerabilities such as information leaks or code execution exploits.

3. To fix the issue, you need to review the code where negative array indexes are being used and ensure that all array indexes are valid and non-negative. You can add appropriate boundary checks to ensure that the array indexes are within the valid range. Additionally, consider revising the logic to prevent negative values from being assigned to array indexes in the first place. By addressing these issues, you can improve the reliability and security of your code.

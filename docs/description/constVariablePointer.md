# Variable 'x' can be declared with const

1. This Cppcheck pattern, constVariableReference, looks for variables that are not declared as const but could be. Specifically, it identifies instances where a variable is not being modified after initialization and could benefit from being declared as const to improve code clarity and potentially catch unintended modifications.

2. Declaring variables as const helps improve code quality and maintainability by clearly indicating to other developers that the variable is not intended to be modified. This can prevent accidental changes to the variable's value, leading to more predictable code behavior. Additionally, using const can help catch potential bugs or unintended side effects caused by inadvertently modifying a variable that should have been constant.

3. To fix the issue highlighted by the constVariableReference pattern, you should simply declare the variable as const if it is not meant to be modified after initialization. In the provided code snippet, the variable 'var' could potentially be declared as const since it is not being modified within the function. To address the issue, update the variable declaration from:
   ```cpp
   const std::string vartype(var->isArgument() ? "Parameter" : "Variable");
   ```
   to:
   ```cpp
   const std::string vartype = var->isArgument() ? "Parameter" : "Variable";
   ```
   By adding the 'const' keyword before the variable type declaration, you make it clear that 'vartype' is a constant value that should not be changed, thus adhering to good coding practices and potentially improving code quality.

# Using 'sizeof' on array given as function argument returns size of a pointer.

1. **What this check looks for:**
   This Cppcheck pattern, identified by the error ID `sizeofwithsilentarraypointer`, looks for instances where the `sizeof` operator is used on an array that is passed as a function argument. In the provided code snippet, the `sizeofForArrayParameterError` function is called when Cppcheck detects this issue.

2. **Why it matters for code quality/security:**
   Using `sizeof` on an array passed as a function argument can lead to incorrect results because in this context, the array is actually treated as a pointer. This can result in unexpected behavior and potential bugs in the code. Incorrectly using `sizeof` on an array can lead to memory access violations, buffer overflows, or other security vulnerabilities, especially if the code assumes that the result of `sizeof` represents the total size of the array.

3. **How to fix the issue:**
   To fix this issue and ensure code correctness and security:
   - If you need to determine the size of the array in bytes within the function, consider using a different approach such as passing the size of the array as an additional parameter or using a standard container like `std::array` or `std::vector`.
   - If you only need the size of the array within the function and not the size in bytes, consider using other mechanisms like template functions or passing a pointer to the array along with the size information.
   - Avoid relying on `sizeof` when working with arrays passed as function arguments to prevent potential issues related to pointer behavior and array size discrepancies.

By addressing this Cppcheck warning and avoiding the improper use of `sizeof` on array function arguments, you can enhance the reliability, maintainability, and security of your C++ codebase.
